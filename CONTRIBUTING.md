# Contributing to the FRAME

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the FRAME.  
This document explains how contributions are organised, reviewed, and integrated into the project.

## 🧭 Contribution Workflow

All contributions follow the lifecycle:

release → feedback → draft iterations → next release

### 1. Identify the target version

Contributions should be made against the **next planned release**, not the last published one.

Drafts are stored in:

```
/drafts/<target-version>-draft.<iteration>
```

The folder:

```
/drafts/latest
```

always points to the most current working draft.

### 2. Propose a change

You may propose changes by:

- Opening an **issue**  
- Submitting a **pull request**  
- Providing feedback through FRAME maintainers working channels  

Please reference:
- The affected release or draft  
- The specific model elements or documentation sections  
- The rationale for the change  

### 3. Draft integration

Approved changes are incorporated into the **next draft iteration**:


```
<target-version>-draft.<iteration+1>
```

Drafts may undergo multiple iterations before stabilisation.

### 4. Release publication

Once a draft is validated and approved by FRAME maintainers, it becomes a new numbered release in:

```
/releases/<version>
```

Releases are **immutable**.

## 🛠 Working With the Models

To contribute to the Enterprise Architect models:

1. Start with a **new, empty EA project**.  
2. Load the **FRAME toolbox**.  
3. Import the relevant draft `.xmi` file.  

Never import the XMI before loading the toolbox.

## 📄 Documentation Contributions

Documentation is maintained as Word exports and supporting materials.  
When contributing:

- Keep structure consistent with FRAME methodology  
- Use clear, concise language  
- Ensure alignment between diagrams, models, and text  

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Contributors are expected to follow FRAME’s collaborative principles:
- Respectful communication  
- Evidence‑based argumentation  
- Transparency of rationale  
- Alignment with European interoperability goals
